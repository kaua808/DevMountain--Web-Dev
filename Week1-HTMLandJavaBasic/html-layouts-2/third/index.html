			 <h1>In More Detail</h1>

				<p>News of an ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook with a Retina display first surfaced in October of 2013, after reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shared information suggesting Apple was working on a revolutionary new MacBook that's even thinner than the existing MacBook Air.</p>

				<p>During the same timeframe, NPD DisplaySearch released supply chain research suggesting Apple was sourcing 12-inch 2304 x 1440 displays destined for a new MacBook.</p>

				<p>12-inch MacBook rumors picked up in March of 2014, with a report sourced from the Asian supply chain pointing towards a device carrying a thin, light design with a redesigned trackpad and no fan assembly for silent operation.</p>

				<p>Initial rumors suggested the 12-inch Retina MacBook might be released in the fall of 2014, but Broadwell chip delays may have pushed back the tablet's launch until 2015. In October of 2014, Intel released updated Broadwell Core M chips that are likely destined for the rumored 12-inch MacBook.</p>

				<p>Many rumors have referred to the 12-inch MacBook as a MacBook Air, but it is unclear if the product will fit into the MacBook Air category given its use of low power chips and its radical redesign. Its existence in the MacBook Air lineup is also questionable given that Apple already produces both 11 and 13-inch versions of the portable notebook.</p>

				<p>If the 12-inch MacBook is destined to join the MacBook Air family, it is possible it will coexist with existing products for a short time before serving as a replacement device, much as the Retina MacBook Pro was sold alongside the standard MacBook Pro before the latter product was all but discontinued in favor of its slimmer, Retina-screened sibling.</p>

				<p>It is very possible that the 12-inch MacBook, with low power chips, silent operation, and an incredibly thin design is the future of the MacBook Air.</p>

				<h1>DISPLAY</h1>

				<p>According to rumors, the 12-inch MacBook will include a Retina display, though a possible resolution remains unclear at this point. The MacBook Air is one of the last Macs to be upgraded with a Retina display, which was brought to the MacBook Pro in 2012 and the iMac in 2014.</p>
