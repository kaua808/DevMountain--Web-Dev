			<p>Today, MacBook Airs come with a USB port and a MagSafe charging port (and a headphone port -- that's staying). The ports are only a few millimeters thick, basically taking up the entire width of the laptop.
			If Apple does make the decision to switch to so-called USB Type C technology, it will be adopting a new, much thinner kind of USB plug that basically does everything.</p>
			<p>Type-C USB is capable of powering a computer, so users won't need a separate MagSafe charger. It can power a display, and it's significantly faster than "old school" USB technology -- fast enough to replace Apple's Thunderbolt ports.</p>
			<p>Best of all, Type-C USB plugs are reversible. That means no more struggling to figure out which way the plug is supposed to go.</p>
