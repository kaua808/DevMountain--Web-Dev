				<p>It's bedtime in a galaxy far, far away, and Darth Vader's parenting skills are being tested by his children, Luke and Leia, in "Goodnight Darth Vader."</p>

				<p>The follow-up to the best-selling books "Darth Vader and Son" and "Vader's Little Princess" by Jeffrey Brown will be released in August. However the book from Chronicle Books will debut at this year's San Diego Comic-Con International in July.</p>

				<p>Darth Vader may be ready for his kids to go to sleep, but his twins, Luke and Leia, want a bedtime story first- -- one that involves the aliens, heroes, villains, and monsters of their world. From Han Solo and Chewbacca to Boba Fett and baby Ewoks, from the wampa ice creature to Jawas, all of the galaxy's denizens are getting ready for a night's rest in this delightful story told in verse, with plenty of nods to the rich "Star Wars" narrative.</p>

				<p>One day Vader went out and walked his AT-AT.  All went well and they bonded greatly.  Their time was only to short with each other as it soon grew to be full size. </p>
